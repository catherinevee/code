I need to create integration tests for the following components:
[List components and their interactions]

Please suggest a set of integration tests that:
1. Cover the main interaction scenarios between these components
2. Test for proper error handling and edge cases
3. Include any necessary setup and teardown procedures

Provide the test scenarios in a clear, step-by-step format, and include any necessary mock objects or test data.

Please help me create a performance test plan that includes:
1. Key performance indicators to measure
2. Test scenarios to simulate various load conditions
3. Suggestions for tools or frameworks to use
4. Strategies for identifying performance bottlenecks
5. Best practices for interpreting and acting on the results
