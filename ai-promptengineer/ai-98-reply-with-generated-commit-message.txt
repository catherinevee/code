[Paste your git diff or describe the changes]

Please help me create a commit message that:
1. Summarizes the changes concisely (50 characters or less for the subject line)
2. Provides more details in the body (wrap at 72 characters)
3. Follows best practices for git commit messages
4. Includes any relevant issue numbers or references

The commit message should be informative enough that team members can understand the changes without having to look at the code.
