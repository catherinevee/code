## Cost Impact Checklist

Before merging infrastructure changes, reviewers should verify:

- [ ] **Resource Sizing**: Are new resources appropriately sized for their intended use?
- [ ] **Environment Parity**: Do non-production environments use cost-appropriate configurations?
- [ ] **Tagging**: Are all new resources properly tagged for cost attribution?
- [ ] **Cleanup**: Are temporary resources configured for automatic cleanup?
- [ ] **Monitoring**: Will new resources be included in cost monitoring?

## Cost Optimization Review

For infrastructure changes, consider:

- [ ] Could this use a smaller instance type initially and scale up if needed?
- [ ] Are we using the most cost-effective storage type for this use case?
- [ ] Could any of these resources benefit from scheduled scaling?
- [ ] Have we considered serverless alternatives where appropriate?

## Questions for the Author

- What is the expected monthly cost impact of this change?
- How did you determine the resource sizing?
- Are there any cost optimization opportunities you considered?
- How will we track the cost effectiveness of this implementation?
