# Architecture Review Template with Cost Considerations

## Architecture Review Checklist

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] Does the design meet all functional requirements?
- [ ] Are performance requirements clearly defined and achievable?
- [ ] Is the system scalable to handle expected load?

### Cost Considerations

- [ ] **Cost Estimation**: What is the estimated monthly cost of this architecture?
- [ ] **Cost Drivers**: What are the primary cost drivers in this design?
- [ ] **Alternatives Considered**: Were lower-cost alternatives evaluated?
- [ ] **Environment Scaling**: How will costs scale across dev/staging/prod environments?
- [ ] **Cost Monitoring**: How will costs be tracked and attributed post-launch?

### Cost Optimization Opportunities

- [ ] **Right-Sizing**: Are compute resources appropriately sized for the workload?
- [ ] **Spot Instances**: Can any workloads use spot instances for cost savings?
- [ ] **Reserved Capacity**: Should any resources use reserved instances or savings plans?
- [ ] **Storage Optimization**: Are appropriate storage tiers and lifecycle policies planned?
- [ ] **Serverless Opportunities**: Could any components benefit from serverless architectures?

### Ongoing Cost Management

- [ ] **Budget Allocation**: Is this project within the team's quarterly budget?
- [ ] **Cost Alerts**: Will appropriate cost monitoring and alerts be implemented?
- [ ] **Optimization Plan**: Is there a plan for ongoing cost optimization?
- [ ] **Sunset Plan**: Is there a plan for resource cleanup when the project ends?

## Cost Impact Analysis

### Estimated Monthly Costs

| Environment | Compute | Storage | Network | Other | Total |
| ----------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ----- | ----- |
| Development | $XXX    | $XXX    | $XXX    | $XXX  | $XXX  |
| Staging     | $XXX    | $XXX    | $XXX    | $XXX  | $XXX  |
| Production  | $XXX    | $XXX    | $XXX    | $XXX  | $XXX  |

### Cost Justification

- **Business Value**: How does the cost relate to expected business value?
- **Cost per User**: What is the expected cost per active user?
- **Break-even Analysis**: At what usage level does this become cost-effective?

### Risk Mitigation

- **Cost Overruns**: What safeguards prevent unexpected cost spikes?
- **Monitoring**: How will cost anomalies be detected and addressed?
- **Emergency Shutdown**: Can resources be quickly scaled down if needed?
