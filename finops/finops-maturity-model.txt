    Basic tagging implementation

Walk: Automated optimization and proactive cost management

    Real-time cost monitoring
    Automated resource scheduling
    Cost attribution by team or project

Run: Advanced optimization and cost-aware culture

    Predictive cost modeling
    Automated optimization at scale
    Cost considerations in all engineering decisions
